## Project Topic: Predicting Mortalities caused by Heart Failure

## Project Scope: To develop machine learning classification models to predict mortalities caused by heart failure. Comparisons will be made to see which is the best classification model for this issue.

### Description: My team and I embarked on a journey to discover the best classification model in order to predict mortalities caused by heart failures. With our overall goal to provide a means to reduce mortalities caused by heart failure. The number of cases for heart failure has risen significantly over the years, and early detection is crucial in order to prevent a higher probablity of death caused by heart failure. 

### Our dataset is obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) and it consist of a total of 12 attributes which are related to causing heart failure.
